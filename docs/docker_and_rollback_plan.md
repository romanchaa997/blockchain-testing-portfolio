# Docker and Rollback Automation Plan

## Dockerization:
- Create a Dockerfile for the project using an Ubuntu base image with Python 3.12.
- Install all project dependencies inside the container.
- Run tests and build processes within Docker for consistent environments.

## Rollback Automation:
- Research methods to detect failed deployments automatically.
- Develop a rollback script that can revert to a previous stable version if a deployment fails.
- Explore integration of rollback mechanisms within GitHub Actions.

## Next Steps:
- Develop a simple Dockerfile and test containerized builds.
- Draft a rollback script and plan its integration into the CI/CD pipeline.
